# Monocular Depth Estimation

**Overview:**
This repository contains implementations and resources for monocular depth estimation, a crucial task in computer vision that involves predicting depth information from a single image. The goal is to enable machines to understand and interpret the three-dimensional structure of scenes.

**Key Features:**
- **State-of-the-art Algorithms:** Implementations of various deep learning models designed for accurate depth prediction.
- **Pre-trained Models:** Access to pre-trained models that can be used for inference or further fine-tuning on custom datasets.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Tools and scripts for evaluating the performance of depth estimation models using standard metrics.
- **Dataset Support:** Instructions on how to use popular datasets for training and testing, such as KITTI, NYU Depth V2, and others.

**Installation:**
To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DynamicChase/Monocular-Depth-Estimation.git
cd Monocular-Depth-Estimation
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Usage:**
Provide examples of how to run the models on sample images or datasets. Include command line instructions or Python scripts.
